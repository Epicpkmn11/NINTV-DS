# NINTV-DS
Nintellivision - an Intellivision Emulator for the Nintendo DS/DSi

NINTV-DS is an Intellivision console emulator running on the DS/DSi.

Install :
----------
To make this work, place NINTV-DS.NDS on your flashcart or SD card which you can launch.
You must have these 3 files in the same directory as your .int ROM files:
grom.bin
exec.bin
knowncarts.cfg

The knowncarts.cfg file is supplied with this emulator. The GROM and EXEC binaries are property
of Intellivision and you will have to find them yourself. Don't ask. If you own Intellivision 
Lives (various over the years), you likely have both files already somewhere in your house. 

Features :
----------
 Most things you should expect from an emulator. 
 Most games run at full speed on a DSi or above.
 Most games will NOT run full speed on the older DS. 

Missing :
---------
Intellivoice games will run but only about 45FPS.
